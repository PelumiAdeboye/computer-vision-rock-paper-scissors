# Computer Vision RPS
This project utilizes an image classification model trained using Teachable Machine. The model is designed to classify images into different classes of Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. The model is saved in the TensorFlow format with the filename `keras_model.h5`, and the corresponding labels are stored in the `labels.txt` file.
